Introduction
============

Each nvidia GPU has several identifying numbers that can be used to determine
supported features, the engines it contains, and the register set. The most
important of these numbers is an 8-bit number known as the "chipset id".
If two cards have the same chipset id, their GPUs support identical features,
engines, and registers, with very minor exceptions. Such cards can however
still differ in the external devices they contain: output connectors,
encoders, capture chips, temperature sensors, fan controllers, installed
memory, supported clocks, etc. You can get the chipset id of a card by reading
from its :ref:`PMC area <pmc-mmio-id>`.

The chipset id is usually written as NVxx, where xx is the id written as
uppercase hexadecimal number. Note that, while cards before NV10 used another
format for their ID register and don't have the chipset id stored directly,
they are usually considered as NV01-NV05 anyway.

Nvidia uses "chipset code names" in their materials. They started out
identical to the chipset id, but diverged midway through the NV40 series
and started using a different numbering. However, for the most part nvidia
code names correspond 1 to 1 with the chipset ids.

The chipset id has a one-to-many relationship with pci device ids. Note that
the last few bits [0-6 depending on chipset id] of PCI device id are
changeable through straps [see :ref:`pstraps`]. When pci ids of a chipset are
listed in this file, the following shorthands are used:

1234
    PCI device id 0x1234
1234*
    PCI device ids 0x1234-0x1237, choosable by straps
123X
    PCI device ids 0x1230-0x123X, choosable by straps
124X+
    PCI device ids 0x1240-0x125X, choosable by straps
124X*
    PCI device ids 0x1240-0x127X, choosable by straps


The chipset families
====================

The chipsets can roughly be grouped into 9 families: NV01, NV03, NV04, NV10,
NV20, NV30, NV40, NV50, NVC0. This aligns with big revisions of PGRAPH, the
drawing engine of the card. While most functionality was introduced in sync
with PGRAPH revisions, some other functionality [notably video decoding
hardware] gets added in chipsets late in a chipset family and sometimes
doesn't even get to the first chipset in the next chipset family. For example,
NV11 expanded upon the previous NV15 chipswt by adding dual-head support, while
NV20 added new PGRAPH revision with shaders, but didn't have dual-head - the
first chipset to feature both was NV25.

Also note that a bigger chipset id doesn't always mean a newer card / card
with more features: there were quite a few places where the numbering actually
went backwards. For example, NV11 came out later than NV15 and added several
features.

Nvidia's card release cycle always has the most powerful high-end chipsets
first, subsequently filling in the lower-end positions with new cut-down
chipsets. This means that newer cards in a single sub-family get progressively
smaller, but also more featureful - the first chipsets to introduce minor
changes like DX10.1 support or new video decoding are usually the low-end
ones.

The full known chipset list, sorted roughly according to introduced features,
is:

- NV01 family: NV01
- NV03 family: NV03
- NV04 family: NV04, NV05
- NV10 family: NV10, NV15, NV1A, NV11, NV17, NV1F, NV18
- NV20 family: NV20, NV2A, NV25, NV28
- NV30 family: NV30, NV35, NV31, NV36, NV34
- NV40 family:

  - NV40 subfamily: NV40, NV45, NV41, NV42, NV43, NV44, NV4A
  - NV47 subfamily: NV47, NV49, NV4B, NV46
  - the IGPs: NV4E, NV4C, NV67, NV68, NV63

- NV50 family:

  - NV50 subfamily: NV50
  - NV84 subfamily: NV84, NV86, NV92, NV94, NV96, NV98
  - NVA0 subfamily: NVA0, NVAA, NVAC
  - NVA3 subfamily: NVA3, NVA5, NVA8, NVAF

- NVC0 family:

  - NVC0 subfamily: NVC0, NVC4, NVC3, NVCE, NVCF, NVC1, NVC8
  - NVD9 subfamily: NVD9, NVD7
  - NVE4 subfamily: NVE4, NVE7, NVE6, NVF0, NV108

Whenever a range of chipsets is mentioned in the documentation, it's written as
"NVxx:NVyy". This is left-inclusive, right-noninclusive range of chipset ids
as sorted in the preceding list. For example, NVA0:NVA8 means chipsets NVA0,
NVAA, NVAC, NVA3, NVA5. NV20:NV30 effectively means all NV20 family cards.


NV01 family: NV01
-----------------

The first nvidia GPU. It has semi-legendary status, as it's very rare and hard
to get. Information is mostly guesswork from ancient xfree86 driver. The GPU
is also known by its SGS-Thomson code number, SGS-2000. The most popular card
using this GPU is Diamond EDGE 3D.

The GPU has integrated audio output, MIDI synthetiser and Sega Saturn game
controller port. Its rendering pipeline, as opposed to all later families,
deals with quadratic surfaces, as opposed to triangles. Its video output
circuitry is also totally different from NV03+, and replaces the VGA part as
opposed to extending it like NV03:NV50 do.

There's also NV02, which has even more legendary status. It was supposed to be
another card based on quadratic surfaces, but it got stuck in development hell
and never got released. Apparently it never got to the stage of functioning
silicon.

The chipset was jointly manufactured by SGS-Thomson and NVidia, earning it
pci vendor id of 0x12d2. The pci device ids are 0x0008 and 0x0009. The device
id of NV02 was supposed to be 0x0010.


NV03 family: NV03, NV03T
------------------------

The first [moderately] sane GPUs from nvidia, and also the first to use AGP
bus. There are two chips in this family, and confusingly both use chipset id
NV03, but can be told apart by revision. The original NV03 is used in RIVA 128
cards, while the revised NV03, known as NV03T, is used in RIVA 128 ZX. NV03
supports AGP 1x and a maximum of 4MB of VRAM, while NV03T supports AGP 2x and
8MB of VRAM. NV03T also increased number of slots in PFIFO cache. These GPUs
were also manufactured by SFS-Thomson and bear the code name of STG-3000.

The pci vendor id is 0x12d2. The pci device ids are:

==== =============
id   chipset
==== =============
0018 original NV03
0019 NV03T
==== =============

The NV03 GPU is made of the following functional blocks:

- host interface, connected to the host machine via PCI or AGP
- two PLLs, to generate video pixel clock and memory clock
- memory interface, connected to 2MB-8MB of external VRAM via 64-bit or
  128-bit memory bus, shared with an 8-bit parallel flash ROM
- PFIFO, controlling command submission to PGRAPH and gathering commands
  through DMA to host memory or direct MMIO submission
- PGRAPH, the 2d/3d drawing engine, supporting windows GDI and Direct3D 5
  acceleration
- VGA-compatible CRTC, RAMDAC, and associated video output circuitry,
  enabling direct connection of VGA analog displays and TV connection via
  an external AD722 encoder chip
- i2c bus to handle DDC and control mediaport devices
- double-buffered video overlay and cursor circuitry in RAMDAC
- mediaport, a proprietary interface with ITU656 compatibility mode, allowing
  connection of external video capture or MPEG2 decoding chip

NV03 introduced RAMIN, an area of memory at the end of VRAM used to hold
various control structures for PFIFO and PGRAPH. On NV03, RAMIN can be
accessed in BAR1 at addresses starting from 0xc00000, while later cards have
it in BAR0. It also introduced DMA objects, a RAMIN structure used to define
a VRAM or host memory area that PGRAPH is allowed to use when executing
commands on behalf of an application. These early DMA objects are limitted to
linear VRAM and paged host memory objects, and have to be switched manually
by host. See :ref:`nv03-dmaobj` for details.


NV04 family: NV04, NV05
-----------------------

Improved and somewhat redesigned NV03. Notable changes:

- AGP x4 support
- redesigned and improved DMA command submission
- separated core and memory clocks
- DMA objects made more orthogonal, and switched automatically by card
- redesigned PGRAPH objects, introducing the concept of object class in hardware
- added BIOS ROM shadow in RAMIN
- Direct3D 6 / multitexturing support in PGRAPH
- bumped max supported VRAM to 16MB
- [NV05] bumped max supported VRAM to 32MB
- [NV05] PGRAPH 2d context object binding in hardware

This family includes the original NV04, used in RIVA TNT cards, and NV05 used
in RIVA TNT2 and Vanta cards.

This is the first chip marked as solely nvidia chip, the pci vendor id is
0x10de. The pci device ids are:

The pci vendor id is 0x10de.

NV1A and NV1F are IGPs and lack VRAM, memory controller, mediaport, and ROM
interface. They use the internal interfaces of the northbridge to access
an area of system memory set aside as fake VRAM and BIOS image.


NV20 family: NV20, NV2A, NV25, NV28
-----------------------------------

The first cards of this family were actually developed before NV17, so they
miss out on several features introduced in NV17. The first card to merge NV20
and NV17 additions is NV25. Notable changes:

- NV20:

  - no dual head support again
  - no PTV, VPE
  - no ZCULL
  - a new memory controller with Z compression
  - RAMIN reversal unit bumped to 0x40 bytes
  - 3d engine extensions:

    - programmable vertex shader support
    - D3D8, shader model 1.1

  - PGRAPH automatic context switching

- NV25:

  - a merge of NV17 and NV20: has dual-head, ZCULL, ...
  - still no VPE and PTV

- NV28:

  - AGP x8 support

The chipsets are:

===== =======  =======  =========  =======  ========

028X  NV28     2        4          8        like NV25, but with added AGP x8 support
===== =======  =======  =========  =======  ========

NV2A is a chipset designed exclusively for the original xbox, and can't be
found anywhere else. Like NV1A and NV1F, it's an IGP.

.. todo:: verify all sorts of stuff on NV2A

The pci vendor id is 0x10de.


NV30 family: NV30, NV35, NV31, NV36, NV34

  - 2-stage PLLs split into two registers
  - VPE engine extended to work as a PFIFO engine

- NV36:

  - a merge of NV31 and NV36 changes from NV30

- NV34:

  - a comeback of NV10 memory controller!

The pci vendor id is 0x10de.


NV40 family

It's not clear how NV40 is different from NV45, or NV41 from NV42,
or NV67 from NV68 - they even share pciid ranges.

The NV4x IGPs actually have a memory controller as opposed to earlier ones.
This controller still accesses only host memory, though.

As execution units can be disabled on NV40+ cards, these configs are just the
maximum configs - a card can have just a subset of them enabled.


NV50 family
-----------

The card where they redesigned everything. The most significant change was the
redesigned memory subsystem, complete with a paging MMU [see :ref:`nv50-vm`].

- NV50:

  - a new VM subsystem, complete with redesigned DMA objects
  - RAMIN is gone, all structures can be placed arbitrarily in VRAM, and
    usually host memory memory as well
  - all-new channel structure storing page tables, RAMFC, RAMHT, context
    pointers, and DMA objects
  - PFIFO redesigned, PIO mode dropped
  - PGRAPH redesigned: based on unified shader architecture, now supports
    running standalone computations, D3D10 support, unified 2d acceleration
    object
  - display subsystem reinvented from scratch: a stub version of the old
    VGA-based one remains for VGA compatibility, the new one is not VGA based
    and is controlled by PFIFO-like DMA push buffers
  - memory partitions tied directly to ROPs

- NV84:

  - redesigned channel structure with a new layout
  - got rid of VP1 video decoding and VPE encoding support, but VPE decoder
    still exists
  - added VP2 xtensa-based programmable video decoding and BSP engines
  - removed restrictions on host memory access by rendering: rendering to host
    memory and using tiled textures from host are now ok
  - added VM stats write support to PCOUNTER
  - PEEPHOLE moved out of PBUS
  - PFIFO_BAR_FLUSH moved out of PFIFO

- NV98:

  - introduced VP3 video decoding engines, and the falcon microcode with them
  - got rid of VP2 video decoding

- NVA0:

  - developped in parallel with NV98
  - VP2 again, no VP3
  - PGRAPH rearranged to make room for more MPs/TPs
  - streamout enhancements [ARB_transform_feedback2]
  - CUDA ISA 1.3: 64-bit g[] atomics, s[] atomics, voting, fp64 support

- NVAA:

  - merged NVA0 and NV98 changes: has both VP3 and new PGRAPH
  - only CUDA ISA 1.2 now: fp64 support got cut out again

- NVA3:

  - a new revision of the falcon ISA
  - a revision to VP3 video decoding, known as VP4. Adds MPEG-4 ASP support.

NVC0 family
-----------

The card where they redesigned everything again.

- NVC0:

  - redesigned PFIFO, now with up to 3 subfifos running in parallel
  - redesigned PGRAPH:

    - split into a central HUB managing everything and several GPCs
      doing all actual work
    - GPCs further split into a common part and several TPs
    - using falcon for context switching
    - D3D11 support

  - redesigned memory controller

    - split into three parts:

      - per-partition low-level memory controllers [PBFB]
      - per-partition middle memory controllers: compression, ECC, ... [PMFB]
      - a single "hub" memory controller: VM control, TLB control, ... [PFFB]

  - ROPs, memory partitions, GPCs, TPs have independent register areas, as well
    as "broadcast" areas that can be used to control all units at once
  - second PCOPY engine
  - redesigned PCOUNTER, now having multiple more or less independent subunits
    to monitor various parts of GPU
  - redesigned clock setting
  - ...

- NVD9:

  - a major revision to VP3 video decoding, now called VP5. vµc microcode removed.
  - another revision to the falcon ISA, allowing 24-bit PC
  - added PUNK1C3 falcon engine
  - redesigned I2C bus interface
  - redesigned PDISPLAY
  - removed second PCOPY engine

- NVD7:

  - PGRAPH changes:

    - ???

- NVE4:

  - redesigned PCOPY: the falcon controller is now gone, replaced with hardware
    control logic, partially in PFIFO
  - an additional PCOPY engine
  - PFIFO redesign - a channel can now only access a single engine selected on
    setup, with PCOPY2+PGRAPH considered as one engine
  - PGRAPH changes:

    - subchannel to object assignments are now fixed
    - m2mf is gone and replaced by a new p2mf object that only does simple
      upload, other m2mf functions are now PCOPY's responsibility instead
    - the ISA requires explicit scheduling information now
    - lots of setup has been moved from methods/registers into memory
      structures
    - ???

- NVF0:

  - PFIFO changes:

    - ???

  - PGRAPH changes:

    - ISA format change
    - ???

.. todo:: figure out PGRAPH/PFIFO changes
